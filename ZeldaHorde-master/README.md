# A* Zombie Horde

In the second year of my Bachelors program we had classes about pathfinding algorithms like A* and minimax to solve mazes and play tictactoe.
Part of that course was to create something cool with A* and thus I made a topdown zombie horde game. 
Where the enemies function with different levels of complexity of algorithms.

Furthermore we had to connect the project to a raspberry pi and use some form of physical interaction to control the game. 
I made a controller board and hooked it up to the pi. Sadly that never really worked since the cip set I had bought doesnt function with python and all I was getting were empty byte strings.
